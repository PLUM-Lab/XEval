A little background, we live in the UK, my GF lives in a different city to me due to our work, and 3 months ago started working at a new post. What I'm about to write is what I've heard from her.\n\nShe went out for a Christmas party with work colleagues and as usual involved dinner and drinks/clubbing. At the end of the night she and her senior (A), who has a higher position, married with children, offered to walk her home. She agreed as she was a bit drunk at this point.\n\nPrevious to this she has talked about A as a mentor who has guided her through the new job an given her some good career guidance. Needless to say she trusted him as a friend.\n\nAnyway, once they were at her home he started making very aggressive advances including trying to remove her dress, kissing her & inappropriate touching. All the while she was saying 'Stop, this isn't right, you have a wife' etc. She made it quite clear about this. He continued and at one point he had removed his pants and was trying to get her to perform oral sex on him. Again she refused and he left shortly after. \n\nShe is extremely upset about this and doesn't want to report it to HR or the police as she doesn't want to relive it and would rather forget about it and try to move on, she believes this will give her closure. I can completely understand but to me the situation is much worse then she is giving off and this needs to be reported to their HR department at the very least.\n\nSince the night occurred she has only told a couple of friends (who do not know A) and me. One friend has told her not to do anything about it and says things like this happens, to me this is completely the wrong thing to say and trivialises the situation. \n\nAt the moment she is very upset and angry, (as am I, I feel by not being there I can't do anything) and would rather forget about what happened. I'm looking for a little guidance as to what I can do for her. Thanks. \n Summary 1:  My girlfriend was sexually assaulted by a senior colleague at work and doesn't want to report it to HR or the police as she doesn't want to relive it.

We're also dogsitting for a friend of ours who adopted 3 of our rescues who had to take an emergency business trip to Columbia (and no, not for that white powder type of business.)\n\nSo right now we have 7 dogs in our house, but we've done that once before and can handle it.\n\nThe real story comes from last summer, when we rescued a mom and her pup from the crawl space of a house that was due to be demolished later that week. We kept the pup, who is one of our core three, and the mom went to live with our friend, and is one of the 4 we're now dogsitting.\n\nThe mom is some kind of husky/akita mix, but is relatively small for her size, coming in around 50 pounds.

In that time I discovered that she was an absolutely awesome person; very smart, and very funny and just enjoyable to be around. Up until just a few weeks ago we would talk for 3-4 hours a day on Skype, and I enjoyed all of it.\n\nNow onto the problem: In the time I spoke to her, she mentioned Prom on several occasions, asking questions like \"Do you know what day Prom is\", also mentioning the occasion when other girls post dress pictures to Facebook, making it a semi-frequent topic for short amounts of conversation. Now I, lacking minor social skills, came to the conclusion that these were some kind of hints, and decided to man-up and ask her. After a relatively simple outing, on the way back home I decided that I would ask, and she proceeded to turn me down. In all honesty, getting turned down is not a huge deal, it is what follows that bothers me.\n\nSince that day, she has not spoken to me at all, it has been 3 weeks now. She wouldn't return any of my texts (all three that I sent over those weeks), removed me from Facebook, and then removed me from her Skype contacts. She avoids communicating with me in person, and appears to avoid me now. There is nothing that I would want more than to continue on as we were just several weeks ago, but she appears to want none of it.

I just enjoy breaking up the monotony of schedule and rigor. \n Summary 1:  My wife and I are stuck in a state of survival and not having fun.

Regardless, I'll share my bland point of view since I was in attendance the entire time.\n\nIn the morning announcements, we were all instructed to empty out our lockers by the end of the day or risk losing whatever we failed to reclaim. Two friends and I \u2014 one friend, Zed (not his real name), being the character of importance \u2014 shared a locker, and the only remaining articles were our history textbooks and Zed's running shoes and opaque water bottle. Zed had told me throughout the year not to touch his bottle because it's \"a bomb\", and I never thought much of it until that day.\n\nDuring our break between second and third period, the three of us returned our textbooks and went with Zed to the bathroom, who intended to wash his bottle. He unscrewed the top and dumped the contents into one of the toilets \u2014 some pale orange liquid that, to me, faintly resembled vomit. He then proceeded to the nearest sink and left the now-empty bottle under some running water. At this point in time, there was nothing in the bathroom that smelled particularly bad.\n\nAlmost instantaneously, the air was pervaded by the most putrid stench conceivable, and, by split-second deduction, we pinpoint the cause to be whatever he poured out into the toilet. Half the people in the bathroom start coughing and grunting after mere seconds, many already trying to push past me and run out. I grabbed my friends and stumbled backwards with them out into the hallway, which was already completely obstructed by people who had retreated or were reluctant to enter (the odor had already seeped well out the doorway).\n\nSoon enough, you had a whole nauseated crowd lingering outside the bathroom, with no one besides us really knowing what was discharging that terrible redolence. I stood on the side laughing for a good ten minutes while the crowd (but not the stink) gradually thinned out, while Zed tried to save any familiar-looking soul that intended to enter the abyss. \n Summary 1:  Friend poured something into his water bottle and left it under running water in a school bathroom, causing a terrible stench that pervaded the school and caused many to vomit. \n Summary 2:  Some friends got their lunch in my toothpaste.

She spends a lot of nights over at my place, and I noticed that whenever I went to take a shower before bed, after I came back she would be on my laptop and quickly close down some open tabs. I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.\n\nI checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. \n\nThat said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.\n\nI don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her.

(Neither of us suggested a friend coming along or anything so I assume it was just one on one). So on the next day it's the go out day and I message her in the morning to meet up with me at ____ later and no response. Later I go there being the hopeful idiot I am and I just wait. Some more waiting.... I message her to ask her if she does plan on coming, no response. I'm pretty sure she was just ignoring my messages at this point... And I eventually go home. Hours later she messages to me that she has a boyfriend and I just... \"Uh ok.\" Next day she greets me and smiles at me like nothing ever happened. At this point I have no idea how to react cause I sorta end up seeing her everyday and yea... \n Summary 1:  Got stood up to go out with a girl I liked and got stood up again later that night by the same person. \n Summary 2:  Asked out a female friend and she agreed to go out but never followed through on it. Turns out she has a boyfriend now and seems to be ignoring my messages.

That he has things he needs to say to me that he's kept bottled up for the last few months and needs to get off his chest. I told him that he wouldn't find the closure he needs by talking to me.

I was calling the Utility providers in my area to set up the gas/water/elec for my new place, but I was informed that gas could not be set up due to owing a past amount. \n\nI am generally good about keeping up on those things, but am only human so I assumed I would have a small sum to pay. Maybe one months worth that I missed at the end of a lease or something like that.

She was in the middle of discussing plot structure or something and I had finally built up enough pressure to let one rip. I let out the loudest earth shaking fart the world had ever seen. My friends in the class started laughing hysterically which led to everyone else laughing. Mrs. R, the bad breath smelling party pooper she was,  got red faced and decided to kick me out of the class. She then sent me to another teacher's classroom where I had to copy 4-5 sentences saying bodily functions are inappropriate in the classroom 100 times.

Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price. \n Summary 1:  Finance is a pseudoscience. \n Summary 2:  I'm not sure finance is a science.

He said I'm a really nice gal, but I'm also the ex-girlfriend of one of his really good friends and that he doesn't want to cause problems and if roles were revered, he wouldn't want his friend with his ex-girlfriend. Which is a totally fair response. I didn't know what to really say. So I just dropped the topic. Did I misread signs? He seemed into me. Or maybe I was too hopeful? Is all hope lost?\n\nBackground: ex-boyfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years. It was a good relationship, but not the best. He cheated on me 3 times. All about a year apart. Ofcourse his friend wouldn't know that. He even girlfriended the last side chick according to facebook. So I'm sure he wouldn't even care. \n Summary 1:  I think I misread the signs. He seems into me. I'm not sure if I'm just being hopeful. \n Summary 2:  Was hanging out with ex-boyfriend. He seemed into me. Says he doesn't want to cause problems if roles were reversed.

She never really did alcohol or any drugs before this to much of any extent but this time she went way farther than she intended and ended up getting very crossfaded. Basically at some point during the night she started getting hit on by her boyfriend at the time's best friend who was sober.

She asked him what had happened and if they even used protection but he wouldn't admit to anything. He wouldn't even say that they had sex. Soon after rumors circulated as they do in high school. She was always known as being incredibly innocent, hell she is a pastor's daughter, but now guys started asking her out of the blue if she would have sex with them if she was drunk. Also rumors got out that she was pregnant (she wasn't).\nAll this had a devastating impact on her self esteem and ego, meanwhile her boyfriend had gotten seriously depressed and was absolutely intolerable to deal with. The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.\nShe left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too.

Work a couple more shifts with him and we talk during the breaks about our interests, and he'd always greet me with a smile and ask me about my day. He's quite a quiet guy and I see him around every now and again on campus outside of work, but not much.\n\nThen I fucked up and caught feelings. \n\nHere's the kicker: because of timetabling availabilities, I haven't seen him since mid-December and I don't know whether it's weird for me to have feelings for him even though we haven't talked or seen each other for almost a month and a half. He graduates this year so part of me wants to pursue it, but the other part of me really really doesn't want to make things awkward at work. I also know that he's busy with extra-curricular activities and his degree as well, so I don't want to waste his time. I've been to some nights out where I thought that he would go as well with his friends as so I could 'coincidentally bump into him' but he doesn't show for most of them so I haven't hung out with him outside work. \n Summary 1:  Have a crush on my quiet coworker, haven't seen him since mid-December, don't know whether it's weird to have feelings for him even though we haven't talked or seen each other for nearly a month. \n Summary 2:  shy, awkward 19 year old female too young for office romances.

I add her on Kik late at night, she adds me when she wakes up before school. We instantly hit it off and text each other during school the whole day and well into the morning (1am). We then talked the rest of the weekend and this whole week. We decided to meet up soon for a movie and some food.

My only memories are with her, I don't talk with anyone except my coworkers. I don't feel *anything* since she left me, I'm not sad, I just don't want anything. I have a job and working for M.S degree, and I just *continue* them, without doing anything for my life. Every day I think about her for a few minutes, and I just feel angry, I don't know why.\n\nShe isn't returning, she made it pretty clear. But it left me in a pretty bad situation, without anyone to help. This is the first time I'm saying these.\n\nActually I don't know what I'm trying to achieve with this post. Maybe writing about it helps.\n\nHave a nice day everyone. \n Summary 1:  Hi.

Once high school started, my friend and I started drifting apart. Her family was incredibly religious and mine was becoming increasingly liberal in the changing political climate. Although our families remained friends throughout it all, I can't help but feel her parents seeing us as a bad influence.

We were friends for a while before we started dating. We've had a lot of problems because of his drinking and when I felt under-appreciated after exhausting myself taking care of him when he was having medical problems, and once when some girl kept sending him naked pics and he didn't discourage it. So we've broken up a couple times. \n\n   I keep getting back together with him because I do love him very much. He's the first person I've been willing to pursue a future with. He asked me if i'd be willing to follow him wherever he got a job (He's getting his doctorate and will need to go wherever he can find teaching positions). I agreed to it. He's told me he wants to marry me and have kids and the whole future bundle. I've never wanted that before, but with him, I do.\n\n  Recently he's been acting strange he said he wanted to move in together, but when I brought up some places I'd found he seemed uncomfortable and weird, he hasn't talked about the future at all the past month and seems distant.\n  This morning his phone was making noises and I went to go look at it (we don't have issues with phones, he plays with mine all the time.) His text menu was open and I saw that he'd recently sent a text to his ex from 5 years ago who he was pseudo engaged with but they broke up after some of her infidelity during long distance.

I have seen it with my own eyes, but I want to get this off of my chest.\n\nI was dating this girl for awhile, about a year and a month or two. We met freshman year of uni basically when I moved in and a month later we were going out. Because of this all of my friends are awkwardly her friends. Either way, when we \"broke up,\" but it was a soft break... I kissed her goodbye before I got on my train home from uni for winter break and she went home and is away this semester for an internship. \n\nThis semester has been hard because I tried talking to her online, not realizing that we were actually broken up for sure (not just breaking because of distance). At the same time she dumps more reasons on me as to why we have broken up. Throughout this I got aggravated, because she was not upfront when we broke up. So after telling me she needs sometime to find herself and be single (100% no ties to me). She gets an OkCupid and is now going out with a guy long distance at another uni in my area (Northeastern). Which completely contradicts the reasons she gave me for breaking up, besides the ones which point to me being a bad person.\n\nThis girl was always a little odd I suppose, but I really loved her. She broke up with me a month after we started dating, but I somehow won her back. She sticks with guys traditionally, but also is a little flighty and doesn't make solid decisions, ever (changed majors every semester or more)...\n\nIt has been 4 months, I am still not 100% over her and she is coming back to the area for the summer (I am staying in the city this summer). I am worried about my old friends, my new friends (which she feels she has claim to) and just my happiness in general. I still love this girl a little, but I mostly just want to move on. I want to see new people get more experience. \n Summary 1:  Was dating girl for awhile, things ended badly, she is now seeing someone else and I still love her but am not over her.

He calls out people when they're wrong, yells at bad drivers, and uses the word \"dumbass\" very liberally. I should clarify that it's never excessive, violent, or directed at me. I kind of admire his assertiveness sometimes. A lot of people would probably see this as a reasonable level of emotion, but I have some problems dealing with it.\n\nAs I mentioned, I (24) am a doormat. I very, very rarely get angry at anything.

We calculated she had unprotected sex twice right when she was ovulating.\n\nI am the only person she confided in about this. I keep telling that I'm here for her, and that we'll figure it out together, and she doesn't have to face this alone. However, I'm internally freaking out. My inner religious upbringing is coming out. The closer this day, the more I'm like \"What is God going to think of me if I accompany this girl to planned parenthood to get an abortion?\"\n\nNow, since coming to college a year ago, I was finally in a safe place where I could admit to myself I was a lesbian, and not freak out about it and try to beat it out of me with religion. So I've been working on trying to figure out my own beliefs about things, and not just what my family thinks.\n\nNow I really don't need any \"God doesn't exist\" type responses because these are my beliefs, and it's actually getting to me. I want to be supportive to my friend, since she decided she could confide in me out of our entire group of friends to help her through this difficult time. \n\nHowever, in supporting her, I don't know how to figure out how to deal with how guilty I feel. I know scientifically, it's not an actual being. This was just so sudden, I haven't had a chance to reflect on what I believe, and how I feel. \n Summary 1:  I'm freaking out about my friend's pregnancy. I'm a religious person, and I'm not sure how to deal with my feelings about it. \n Summary 2:  Friend might be pregnant, I'm the only person she told, and I'm freaking out about how I feel about her having to go through this alone. \n", "output": ["accuracy: 1 \n coverage: 3 \n Explanation: for this summary, the evaluation results in term of accuracy and coverage are different, which means accuracy and coverage may not be correlated and aligned."], "human_score": [1]}, {"id": "tldr_aspect_comp_contrastive_diff_accuracy_coverage_t3_4ectz5_363", "input": "Source post: My boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me because he didn't want a relationship anymore.

He quickly quiets down when you ask him to. (Most of the time except when he is in the yard alone) He gets along very well with other dogs and people.

I do alot of indoor training/play with him as well.\n\nThe other day my friends phone rang and he stood up about to answered it. At the same time my dog started growling and attacked him.

We decided to give the LDR a try, and we've made it work. We have discussed in depth the concept of me moving in with him and looking for a job in his area when I finish school. His area has many job opportunities in my field, and we are both certain that this is a positive move for both of us.\n\nMy mother is convinced that I need to move back home to quickly pay down my student debt (which will be less than $10k). I see her point, and initially agreed - we had this conversation while my boyfriend and I were in an argument, which was a result of the distance, and has since been resolved. Currently, my mom thinks I am 100% moving back with her and my dad [53M].\n\nI don't have a strained relationship with my mom, but our relationship certainly improved when I moved out to go to school. When I do visit my parents, I spend the most time with my brother [17M], who will be moving out to go to school in the fall. I don't think my dad has an opinion of where I go, so long as I am happy.\n\nMy mind is made up about where I want to go - I have given it a lot of thought and after weighing my options, my boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together. I'm afraid that when I tell my mom what I've decided, she will be hurt and object. I've never had to approach such a topic with her before, and am unsure how to proceed. \n Summary 1:  I plan to move in with my boyfriend instead of my mom.

It's a little out of my budget long term, but it's month to month so I thought I could just get it for three months or so and not lose too much money on rent. I tentatively agreed to take it, but no money changed hands.

I assumed that someone else had taken it and they just didn't want to tell me (this has happened to me a lot looking for a room share). \n\nHowever while time went by I started thinking about it and decided I wasn't sure about this place.

I'm quite confused as to why I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her - Is it because I either:\n\na) Am not really that interested in her. \n\nb) Realise that this relationship is doomed because she is moving back to her home country at the end of next year. \n\nc) Am still numb from the pain that my ex-girlfriend inflicted on me when she cheated on me a year ago.\n\nd) Am growing up/have a job and therefore the feeling of infatuation has reduced, but I'm also too busy with work to care.\n\ne) All of the above \n Summary 1:  I'm not sure how I feel about this girl, but I'm not sure if it's because I'm not that interested in her or because I'm not that interested in her. \n Summary 2:  Why am I not as infatuated with this girl who is on paper, perfect for me, as I normally am with other girls before? \n", "output": ["accuracy: 1 \n coverage: 3 \n Explanation: for this summary, the evaluation results in term of accuracy and coverage are different, which means accuracy and coverage may not be correlated and aligned."], "human_score": [1]}, {"id": "tldr_aspect_comp_contrastive_diff_accuracy_coverage_t3_1ntpjr_271", "input": "Source post: I graduated college last August and got a job working in Charlotte.

(22)\nA= R's best friend, guy I am currently dating. (22)\nMe= 20\n\nAnyway, R and I started hanging out and talking to each other around December of last year. Eventually I met A in February of this year and we started going on dates in March. We slept together in May...obviously we moved a bit fast but we both didn't really find it an issue. We saw each other a lot, whether it was just the two of us hanging out or the trio all together. In early May, R had to go away for military training for 2 weeks. In those two weeks A and I got pretty close emotionally, with him sharing some personal stuff with me, showing me childhood places of memory, etc. But when R got back...things were different. All of a sudden we see each other maybe once or twice a week instead of the 3 or 4 that we did. We started having sex less.  The texting/messaging/effort to talk to me slowed down. Compliments are slowed down as well.\n\nWhile this could be due to outside reasons (he's taking 3 online classes over the summer and working more), part of me is taking wisdom from \"He's Just Not That Into You\" and thinking that if the guy really liked me, he would make more of an effort like he used to- I mean shit...it's been only like 2 months, little early to get bored in a relationship. \n\nThe other day I asked him straight up if he was still interested in pursuing a relationship with me and he seemed taken aback that I thought otherwise. I explained to him how I'm feeling and he thinks I'm worrying too much. I hate to use facebook as an example but when people chat with him on there he replies a lot quicker and more often than if I do so.\n\nAm I worrying too much or is this just a dying ship that I need to hop off of? \n Summary 1:  Guy I'm dating has been acting distant lately.

I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a \"$60k wedding\" and \"the groom/his family\" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.

I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.

She greatly imply/outright said that we could happen in the future when I'm more ready to date. It seemed sincere. She wants to be friends but I've determined that I just can't do that and have asked for us to not be in contact for a bit.\n\nBUT:\n\nMy question is... was she just being nice (if misguided)? Does this ever really happen or is it just wishful thinking? Either way I'm going to try to just get over it/her and focus on myself. However, part of me - because of this great connection - doesn't want to kill all hope. At the same time I think holding onto that hope even a little bit might impede my personal growth. \n Summary 1:  I'm 27, she's 25. We dated intensely for a week. I was falling HARD, and way too fast... it felt disproportionate to how well we knew each other. She felt at this point I would bring drama into her \n Summary 2:  If - due to bad timing or whatever - someone says they think it might work out in the future, do they mean it? Is it just wishful thinking? Does it ever work out in the future? \n", "output": ["accuracy: 1 \n coverage: 2 \n Explanation: for this summary, the evaluation results in term of accuracy and coverage are different, which means accuracy and coverage may not be correlated and aligned."], "human_score": [1]}, {"id": "tldr_aspect_comp_contrastive_diff_accuracy_coverage_t3_3rgbqg_348", "input": "Source post: i just had a long ass conversation with unintelligible twats about why my internet service is only 1% functional of what I paid for.

Doesn't want any kind of career it seems, but I find myself embittered by how selfish that feels, because I work so many hours.\n\nLong story short he just refuses to think about any practical parts of life, how to sustain a life financially (maybe because he is willing to get help from his parents when he needs it?).

If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence.

I was trying to fall asleep a bit earlier than usual (around 11PM) because I had a job interview at 9AM, but kept waking up every 5 minute because of this one fucking mosquito that would just pierce through my skin and bounce without even getting a decent meal from my vasculature.

The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  \n\nWe discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied. I read the full market value of the land is deductible but what does that mean in terms of tax refunds come next year? \n\nI want to do some good for the community; I have a BA in architecture and during college I was involved in community building and designed low income housing for those in need. My father has a similar sentiment but is business oriented and wants to reclaim his investment. I feel like this solution scratches both itches. Also, I would be lying if I didn't get some enjoyment at the prospect of inconveniencing the neighbors. Any ideas or information is welcome even if they aren't directly related to this idea. I just need advice on how to move the property with the maximum benefit for all (except those dick neighbors.) \n Summary 1:  Want to donate or sell 2.3 acres of property to maximize tax savings. Need help on how to do this with the least impact on neighbors. \n Summary 2:  If I donate a piece of land to charity out of spite, can I deduct it from my taxes and if so, how much of the value would be retuned as a refund (all, none, some?) \n", "output": ["accuracy: 2 \n coverage: 2 \n Explanation: for this summary, the evaluation results in term of accuracy and coverage are the same, which means accuracy and coverage may be correlated and aligned."], "human_score": [2]}, {"id": "tldr_aspect_comp_contrastive_diff_accuracy_coverage_t3_4z4r1q_124", "input": "Source post: Been volunteering for a local non-profit for about 2 years in the hopes of getting some admin skills to beef up my resume.

About about halfway through, I graduated and left university. Since then, we've been doing long-distance, but it's only about a 2 hour drive (I understand this is not a vast distance). Since then, I've tried my best to visit, sometimes she does (once every 3 weeks at most, typically every two weeks with back-to-back weekends not uncommon). She can be a bit needy and clingy. I try to cater to those needs, within reason. I send care packages, talk to her often, and do my best to spoil her when we do see each other.

She's apprehensive about our future because it is highly likely that we won't ever be in the same city for the foreseeable future. In spite of this, I'm fully committed to her. She is a good person, the type of woman I want to be with and have a future with. Unfortunately, she's apprehensive because she sees sadness as a component of being long-distance.

When we started dating, things were really great, really easy, and went really fast. Within a month we were already so close and I could see myself marrying this girl within a year or two (I'm 23, she's 26). We get along great, spend decent time together, and I can tell that she really cares about me. She has all the qualities of a good spouse, good mother, good life partner.\n\nWe've now been dating for 4-5 months and things are starting to slow down and I'm becoming less passionate about the relationship. I want to be with her, but i'm not crazy passionate about it. I don't wake up every morning with a burning desire to be with her, crazy about being with her. I know that it's unrealistic to have this feeling every minute of everyday, but I haven't felt that way since the first few weeks of our relationship.\n\nI also have to admit, even though it makes me feel shallow and a bad person, that my attraction to her isn't top notch. I am attracted to her, and we do have a physical aspect of our relationship, but she's not the most attractive women I know (or dated).\n\nI should also mention that we are both christain and that God is a central part of our relationship. Its something that we can share together and has been a good way to bring us together. I've slept with 2 girls before, she's a virgin, we have decided to wait before marriage to have sex. I'm ok with it, though I do fear that it will have an impact on our intimacy (possibly a source for my lack of attraction?)\n\nSo what should I do? Am i expecting too much from the relationship? Is physical attraction an unimportant thing in the long run as long as we have an intimate connection? If I choose to ignore these feelings, will they come back to haunt the relationship later?\n\nThanks for your help. \n Summary 1:  I'm struggling with a lack of passion in my relationship.

I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011. \n Summary 1:  So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. \n Summary 2:  Found a Garmin Forerunner 305 for $160 at Best Buy.

I offer to take her out.\n\nWe both dress up, and I took her to this little seafood restaurant, and go see a movie after. The movie I wanted to see so that wasn't really a problem. But I paid for all of it. Every dime.\n\nThroughout the course of the evening all the repressed feelings I had resurfaced, we kissed, it was a bomb time. \n\nAt the end she asks me to drive her to her ex's place. Are you kidding me?!?

Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. \n\nHe is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.

I wasn't nearly as upset as I probably should've been, considering I was expecting closer to 400lbs.\n\nThat very day, I took the first step. I made a myfitnesspal account, and tracked a typical day for me, with no changes. I was very, very quickly disgusted. I discovered two things that fascinated me. The first being, that I DONT over eat. I do however, drink incredible amounts of calories. I found I was drinking TWO THOUSAND calories on a good day. Well, clearly I've established what I need to change most, right? Right.\n\nThe next day, and every day since, I've completely stopped drinking soda, and went into what I believe was a sugar/caffeine withdrawal. Years of drinking hundreds upon hundreds of calories worth of soda has left me more than a little messed up. I allow myself 1 glass of coke a week, and so far this has kept off any cravings, yay! \n\nNow for the advice I need. As I said, I've been tracking my progress with myfitnesspal, hoping to lose 100lbs within a year. Myfitnesspal puts me at approximately 2500cal/day at a loss of 2lbs/week.

I'm not sure. \n\nI am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. \n\nTwo weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. \n\nThese are all my guesses: \n\n1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. \n\n2. Change of bed? \n3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. \n4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. \n5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me). Energy plummeted a few days later. \n\nAny thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I be worried? \n Summary 1:  I'm a new runner and I'm having trouble running more than 2 miles.

The home was a foreclosed property, owned by Aurora Mortgage Services.  Closing date, dictated by the seller, was to be February 10th, 2012 (tomorrow).  We fulfilled our end of agreement - provided earnest money deposit, secured financing, obtained insurance, and as far as we were concerned were ready for closing.  As a matter of fact, title agency (again, dictated by the seller) contacted us and scheduled the time for the actual close.  However, on Tuesday, February 7th, we were notified that Aurora has placed all of their assets on hold \"until further notice\", but that periodically, properties will be \"released from hold\" - whatever that might mean.  \nI've done some research online and came up with [this blog]  It appears that we are not the only ones currently dealing with this.\nSo now, our options are to file for an extension, or get our earnest money back and walk.

We don't necessarily want to walk, because we like the house, but our current lease is set to expire next month.

So the fluid surrounding her brain was leaking causing it to sink on her brain stem and she began to have low pressure headaches.\n\nThey put a drain into her spine to help relieve pressure off of the leak in her skull, but during the procedure the tech had missed his entry point and had mistakenly herniated one of her discs. As a result of this two of her vertebrae collapsed and are now putting pressure on a nerve. It has been over four years since that has happened, she has had a surgery to fix her collapsed septum, and will have several more procedures placing localized pain killers on her nerve endings to help her sciatica she now has as a result of the pressure from her vertebrae. Once they have the sciatica under control they will prepare her spine for surgery and begin the repair process on her vertebrae and herniated disc. \n Summary 1:  So this actually happened a couple years back. Me and my girlfriend had recently just moved in together and had sat down to watch a movie one night. \n Summary 2:  While watching a movie my girlfriend accidentally kneeed me in the face causing a cerebrospinal fluid leak which resulted in two vertebrae collapse and putting pressure on a nerve. \n", "output": ["accuracy: 1 \n coverage: 3 \n Explanation: for this summary, the evaluation results in term of accuracy and coverage are different, which means accuracy and coverage may not be correlated and aligned."], "human_score": [1]}, {"id": "tldr_aspect_comp_contrastive_diff_accuracy_coverage_t3_2g2i0f_941", "input": "Source post: I am currently in college and I met this wonderful girl.

There was a long... looooong moment of silence. After which she teased me and called me a few names I won't mentioned here she began to laugh about the whole situation. We were on good terms still but I couldn't help but feeling like the worst kind of person in the world. \n Summary 1:  Sent a friend a link to the Cave Johnson speech from Portal 2 and she watched it to the end, including the part about \"I'm gonna burn your house down\". \n Summary 2:  Sent a friend a video of Cave Johnson screaming \" I'M GONNA BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN!!\", and his response to her was to call me a few names. \n", "output": ["accuracy: 1 \n coverage: 1 \n Explanation: for this summary, the evaluation results in term of accuracy and coverage are the same, which means accuracy and coverage may be correlated and aligned."], "human_score": [1]}, {"id": "tldr_aspect_comp_contrastive_diff_accuracy_coverage_t3_2nerhw_61", "input": "Source post: On our second date I told her I had Bipolar 2 and she was fine with it.

Last August, I (29M) started working full time after a LONG period of unemployment. Before that I worked freelance as a graphic/web designer and photographer but it wasn't enough to make a decent living. I own professional equipment and have 5 weddings under my belt, but my biggest problem is self-promotion and advertising (I'm not the most confident person when it comes to selling myself). At this new job, I'm working 40+ hours a week making $15/hr. The job is related to my field (graphic design), but it's not a creative position. I'm basically pumping out orders for this company based off of templates. The first few months were okay since I was learning new techniques and a new program, but now I feel like a robot and this place is sucking the life/energy out of me. There is no sick time, no personal time, the building itself is not well-maintained, and there is nowhere to move up in the company. The only thing keeping me going is the idea that it's not permanent. My plan was to make it a year at this place, save some money, and figure out the rest when the time came. I live with my SO and am lucky to have very low expenses (<$500/mo) I've managed to save around 15k in the time I've been there. I miss the freedom that came with freelance work, but having a steady paycheck is certainly nice. It's very tough to find a job in my area, so on one hand I feel lucky to be in the situation I'm in, but on the other I feel like I can do much better. \n Summary 1:  29M working full time in a dead-end job.

It seemed like somehow we were actually going to avoid a messy friends-with-benefits falling out of sorts.\n\nAnyways, she and I ended up having an open conversation about the possibility of dating. We decided that there was some stuff I had to take care of first, but we were both into the idea and agreed to be platonic friends until we would (really inevitably at this point) start dating.\n\nAnd then, a few days after that conversation, I got really, way too drunk and made out with one of our mutual friends. Hoo boy. While this mutual friend and I talked and agreed it was a stupid mistake that we didn't want to repeat, my friend (rightfully so) became very hurt.

Especially with it being too long of a distance to be able to see each other often, we both thought it was wisest not to put any pressure to keep something afloat between us.\n\nHaving said that, the last time I visited I started thinking \"Why not?\" and have been starting to have major feelings for her. She did too, at least for the first few days after I visited, but like everything long distance, time and distance starts to numb the feelings a bit. \n\nWith my growing affection for this girl, I've noticed myself getting more jealous and insecure about what she's doing all the time.

It would be unfair for me to ask her who she is with and what she is doing without having grounds to worry, if that makes any sense. I wouldn't mind being exclusive, but if she tells me she does not want it or wants to \"see what happens\" then I feel I might get hurt if or when she finally does find someone. I think I may be unintentionally exclusive from my end for someone who does not feel the same drive. \n Summary 1:  Started a long distance relationship too late, have feelings for my girlfriend but don't want to pressure her into exclusivity when we have never explicitly discussed it.

Post relationship, I maintained a sort of \"gay best friend\" friendship with her; a very very close platonic partnership. Jane was supportive me of in my quest for love through high school, and I tried to help her out as well, but she has yet to have any luck whatsoever.\n\nRecently I started dating a third girl, who we will call Jill. Jill is in the same small friend group as Jane is, and I gained interest in Jill at the beginning of this year of high school.

However these didn't include a date or anything, so I opted to not believe him. But the seed of doubt was placed and it just grew from there. I honestly thought my girlfriend was only ever talking to me (while we were dating, she said this multiple times). We've only been official for about a month mind you, but I read some stuff that makes me question her feelings for me. Basically she never stopped talking to her ex (even though she claimed otherwise) and was also seeing another guy and telling him that she was \"falling pretty hard for him\". Don't chastise me for going through her texts, I feel like shit for it already. I normally don't do that, but something in my gut just told me to. The worst part is that we have a lease together and theres still about 6 months left. I honestly don't know what to do or feel. The only thing I can say for sure is that the \"sexting\" aspect of these texts really only happened before we were official. It's just, how can you tell someone that you're falling for them, then turn around and announce a relationship with someone else? \n Summary 1:  Read some of my girlfriends texts that suggest she was still talking to her ex-fiance even after we became official. Don't know if I should confront her or never think about it again. \n Summary 2:  I read some of her texts and I regret it. But I don't know if I should confront her about it or not. \n", "output": ["accuracy: 2 \n coverage: 1 \n Explanation: for this summary, the evaluation results in term of accuracy and coverage are different, which means accuracy and coverage may not be correlated and aligned."], "human_score": [2]}, {"id": "tldr_aspect_comp_contrastive_diff_accuracy_coverage_t3_1r5pg4_184", "input": "Source post: I've been friends with this guy, let's call him L. for a few months, mostly online since we live in different cities.
