You need to evaluate the quality of the response on a specific aspect. Decide if the response is understandable in the context and assign a score between 0 and 1 (Not if its on topic, but for example if it uses pronouns they should make sense). A score of 0 (no) means that the response is difficult to understand. You do not know what the person is trying to say. A score of 1 (yes) means that the response is understandable. You know what the person is trying to say. Indicate your answer as 0 or 1 corresponding to the definition of each score.\n"], "Input_language": ["English"], "Output_language": ["English"], "Instruction_language": ["English"], "Domains":
