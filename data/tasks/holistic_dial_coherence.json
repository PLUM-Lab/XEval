A score of 2 means the response is somewhat not coherenct. A score of 3 means you cannot determine if the response is coherenct or not. A score of 4 means the response is somewhat coherenct. A score of 5 means the response is strongly coherenct. Indicate your answer as 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 corresponding to the definition of each score.\n"
